1. What is the output of the following program? Be precise about where there are spaces and where there are newlines.
Hint: Start by describing in words what ping and baffle do when they are invoked.

When ping is called, it prints: 
".\n"

When baffle is called, it prints "wug" and then calls ping. Therefore, in sum, it prints: 
"wug.\n"

When zoop is called, it calls baffle, prints "You wugga" followed by a space, and then calls baffle again. Therefore, in sum, it prints: 
"wug.\nYou wugga wug.\n"

Examining the main method, the final output is: 
"No, I wug.\nYou wugga wug.\nI wug.\n" 

Or formatted with new lines: 
"No, I wug.
 You wugga wug.
 I wug.
"

2. Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time ping is invoked.

zoop [   ]
baffle [   ]
ping [   ]
baffle [   ]
ping [   ]
baffle [   ]
ping [   ]

3. What happens if you invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping method? (We will see why in the next chapter.)

If baffle() is invoked at the end of ping, a stack overflow will eventually arise. This can be illustrated by a stack diagram when baffle() is called just a single time: 

baffle [   ]
ping [   ]
baffle [   ]
ping [   ]
